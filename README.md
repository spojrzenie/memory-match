## About
Memory Match is a fun and interactive game designed to test and improve your memory skills. The game is built using modern web technologies and is a great example of interactive web application development.

## Technologies Used
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Sass (SCSS):** A preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
- **TypeScript:** A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
- **HTML & CSS:** Standard technologies for building and designing web pages.

## Game Mechanics
The game features a set of cards that players must match based on their names. The game tracks the number of moves and the time taken to match all pairs, offering an option to save these results.

### Key Components
- **Game.tsx:** Manages the core gameplay logic, including card shuffling, flipping, and matching.
- **Results.tsx:** Handles the display and saving of the game results.
